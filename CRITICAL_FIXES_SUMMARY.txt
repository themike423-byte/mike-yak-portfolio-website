CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - December 18, 2025
==========================================

ISSUE #1: PARTNER CATEGORIES IN HERO SECTION ❌ CRITICAL
--------------------------------------------------------

**Fix Applied:** 
- Removed misplaced partner categories from hero section
- Fixed HTML closing tag structure
- Moved categories to correct location INSIDE Partners section
- Now appears under "Complete Partnership Portfolio" heading

**Result:** Hero section now shows ONLY:
- Title: "Building ecosystems that scale"
- Subtitle about AI integrations
- Two CTA buttons
- Profile photo with floating cards

---

--------------------------------------------------
**Problem:** Site said "two young kids" but user has ONE kid.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed "two young kids" to "one kid" in paragraph text
- Changed interest tag from "Two Kids" to "One Kid"

**Result:** Personal section now accurately reflects family situation.

ISSUE #3: EM DASHES THROUGHOUT SITE ❌
---------------------------------------
**Problem:** Multiple em dashes (—) used throughout, user requested regular dashes or rewrites.

**Fixes Applied:**

- Personal section: Changed "earth—NorCal" to "earth (NorCal)"
- Personal section: Changed "Dry Creek—I've" to "Dry Creek. I've"

**Result:** All em dashes removed, replaced with commas, periods, or parentheses.

ISSUE #4: "CATEGORY X OF 4" LABELS ❌
------------------------------------
**Problem:** User didn't want "Category 1 of 4", "Category 2 of 4" labels.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `<div class="partner-category-label">Category X of 4</div>` from all 4 sections
- Kept only title and description for each category

**Result:** Clean category headers without numbering.
